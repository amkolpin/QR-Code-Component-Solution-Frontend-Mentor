## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Back to writing HTML/CSS after a long break. I priorized getting all the HTML organized and written before I started with CSS. I tried to use classes instead of divs when writing the CSS. 
 

### Continued development

I will continue to futher my experince writing HTML/CSS with Frontend Mentor. I am really liking it so far! For this project I want to add hover effects over the hyperlinks!

### Useful resources
I used W3Schools to refesh my memory.
